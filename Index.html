                                               Hi, I'm Ayanda Maphanga — a creative and analytical thinker with a background in Industrial Engineering and a growing passion for technology, design, and digital innovation.
                                               <br>Currently, I'm studying at the FNB App Academy to become a skilled app developer, where I'm building hands-on experience in software development.<br>My journey into tech is backed by a strong foundation in process optimization, data analysis, and workflow design gained through my work at Transnet Port Terminals and Transnet Engineering.
                                               <br>In addition to coding, I have a keen eye for design and a solid understanding of UI/UX principles.<br>I also enjoy creating clean, impactful logos and interfaces that enhance user experience and bring ideas to life visually. Whether it's mapping out a user journey, designing a sleek logo, or coding a new app feature, I bring a mindset of innovation, curiosity, and continuous improvement.
                                               <br>This portfolio is a reflection of my skills, growth, and commitment to building solutions that are not only functional—but also intuitive and engaging.<br>Let's connect and create something impactful!
